# Lua API Man Pages
This repository converts the sources for the lua reference manual into man pages for all API functions. Just run `make` to build the package, you have to install
it yourself. 
# Current Status
Currently this only provides very little information (only the function and the description) with bad formatting, but it does the job. Pull requests with feature
improvements are very welcome.
